The backend system follows a modular, layered architecture that separates concerns into authentication, request handling, business logic, and data persistence layers. 
User authentication is handled through a stateless RESTful API using JWT-based authorization, ensuring secure and scalable session management.
Medical inputs, provided either as raw text or PDF files, are processed through dedicated API endpoints that act as controllers, which validate requests and delegate heavy computation to an external Python-based AI inference service. 
This service-oriented interaction enables loose coupling between the web server and the machine learning model.
The system uses a normalized relational database schema with clearly defined entities, relationships, and constraints to ensure data integrity, consistency, and auditability. 
Core workflows are modeled using composition for request–result lifecycle management and aggregation to represent the complete medical analysis process. 
The design supports horizontal scalability, fault isolation, and future extensibility, making it suitable for production-grade medical AI applications.

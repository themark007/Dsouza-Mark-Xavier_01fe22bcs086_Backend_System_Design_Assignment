This ER diagram models an AI-based medical analysis system with a clear separation of concerns and strong data integrity. It uses generalization to derive specialized roles such as Doctor and Admin from a common Users entity, enabling role-based behavior while sharing authentication data. Medical Requests submitted by users form the core workflow and are **compositionally linked to Medical Results, ensuring results cannot exist without their corresponding requests. The complete AI inference lifecycle is captured through aggregation in the Medical Analysis entity, which conceptually combines requests and results for auditing, analytics, and history tracking. Weak entities like Refresh Tokens support secure session management, while associative entities manage many-to-many relationships between users and AI models. Overall, the design is normalized, scalable, audit-ready, and well-suited for secure medical data processing systems.
